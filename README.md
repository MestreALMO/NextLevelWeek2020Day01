# Next Level Week 2020 Day 01

This is the code I did in the fist day of Next Level Week 2020. More preciselly it happened in the date: 03/08/2020.
This  event will certainly get my skills on React super high, I'm up for the whole thing. I'll give my maximum, to make this code as awesome as possible.

But What is the Next level week? It is a event with a lot of code, learning, challenges, networking and getting the participants to the next level.
