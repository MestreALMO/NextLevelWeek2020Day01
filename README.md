# Next Level Week 2020 Day 01

This is the code I did in the fist day of Next Level Week 2020. More preciselly it happened in the date: 03/08/2020.

This code has as objective build a code that can open as app and web:
Here is how it should look like when the app is done:

And here is how the web should be when done:

But What is the Next level week? It is a event with a lot of code, learning, challenges, networking and getting the participants to the next level. The event is in portuguese, so I'm translating everything and showing how the things are happening.

Today in the event was done 3 screens, those two of then are already done, all in React and fully responsive, here is the lading screen (kinda of a index):
